When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
# Load the "lpSolveAPI" packages.
library(lpSolve)
library(lpSolveAPI)
```

```{r}
# setting working directory
getwd()
setwd("C:/Users/TARAKRAM/OneDrive/Desktop/QMM_code/Assignment3")
```
# From Assignment-2 LP problem we again have to find objective function, constraints, variables.
```{r}
# start the lp problem with 12 constraints and 9 decision variables.
lprec <- make.lp(12,9)
```


```{r}
# Set the objective function for the problem.
set.objfn(lprec, c(420,420,420,360,360,360,300,300,300))
# Change the direction to set maximization
lp.control(lprec, sense = "max")
```


```{r}
# Set the constraint values row by row
# Capacity constraints:
set.row(lprec, 1, c(1,1,1), indices = c(1,4,7))
set.row(lprec, 2, c(1,1,1), indices = c(2,5,8))
set.row(lprec, 3, c(1,1,1), indices = c(3,6,9))
# Storage constraints:
set.row(lprec, 4, c(20,15,12), indices = c(1,4,7))
set.row(lprec, 5, c(20,15,12), indices = c(2,5,8))
set.row(lprec, 6, c(20,15,12), indices = c(3,6,9))
# Sales constraints:
set.row(lprec, 7, c(1,1,1), indices = c(1,2,3))
set.row(lprec, 8, c(1,1,1), indices = c(4,5,6))
set.row(lprec, 9, c(1,1,1), indices = c(7,8,9))
# Capacity usage constaints:
set.row(lprec, 10, c(900,900,900,-750,-750,-750), indices = c(1,4,7,2,5,8))
set.row(lprec, 11, c(450,450,450,-900,-900,-900), indices = c(2,5,8,3,6,9))
set.row(lprec, 12, c(450,450,450,-750,-750,-750), indices = c(1,4,7,3,6,9))
```


```{r}
# Set the right hand side values
rhs <- c(750,900,450,13000,12000,5000,900,1200,750,0,0,0)
set.rhs(lprec, rhs)
```

```{r}
# Set the constraint type
set.constr.type(lprec, c("<=","<=","<=","<=","<=","<=","<=","<=","<=","=","=","="))
```

For this problem, all values must be greater than 0.

```{r}
# Set the boundary condiiton for the decision variables
set.bounds(lprec, lower = rep(0, 9))
```


```{r}
# Set the names of the rows (constraints) and columns (decision variables)
lp.rownames <- c("Plant 1 Capacity", "Plant 2 Capacity", "Plant 3 Capacity", "Plant 1 Storage", "Plant 2 Storage", "Plant 3 Storage", "Large Sales", "Medium Sales", "Small Sales", "Plant 1 and 2 Usage", "Plant 2 and 3 Usage", "Plant 1 and 3 Usage")
lp.colnames <- c("Plant 1L", "Plant 2L", "Plant 3L", "Plant 1M", "Plant 2M", "Plant 3M", "Plant 1S", "Plant 2S", "Plant 3S")
dimnames(lprec) <- list(lp.rownames, lp.colnames)
```

This command should return the linear program outline before executing the code, so we can determine if all the values are correct.

```{r}
# Return the linear programming object to ensure the values are correct
lprec
# The model can also be saved to a file
write.lp(lprec, filename = "Assignment-3.lp", type = "lp")
```

The following code will now look for an optimal solution. If it returns a "0" value then that means the model has found an optimal solution.

```{r}
# Solve the linear program
solve(lprec)
```

The model returned a "0", so it has found an optimal solution to the problem.

The function below will return what the maximum value for the objective function will be.

```{r}
# Review the objective function value
get.objective(lprec)
```

In this case, the maximum profits that can be achieved with these constraints is $696,000 per day.

Next, we will return the values of the decision variables to decide how many units of each type of product the plants should make.

```{r}
# Get the optimum decision variable values
get.variables(lprec)
```

Optimum decision variable values from the model:

Plant 1, Large: 516.67 units/day
Plant 2, Large: 0 units/day
Plant 3, Large: 0 units/day
Plant 1, Medium: 177.78 units/day
Plant 2, Medium: 666.67 units/day
Plant 3, Medium: 0 units/day
Plant 1, Small: 0 units/day
Plant 2, Small: 166.67 units/day
Plant 3, Small: 416.67 units/day

The following two segments of code will tell us where our values fall within the constraints, as well as return the surplus between the constraint and the actual value from the constraints.

```{r}
# Get the constraint values for the problem
get.constraints(lprec)
```

```{r}
# Review the surplus for each constraint
get.constraints(lprec) - rhs
```

The "get.sensitivity.rhs()" function will be used to identify the shadow prices for the right hand side and objective function of the formulated linear programming problem.

```{r}
get.sensitivity.rhs(lprec)
```

```{r}
get.sensitivity.obj(lprec) 
```

## Dual Problem:


```{r}
# Begin the dual lp problem with 9 constraints and 12 decision variables.
lprecdual <- make.lp(9,12)
```


```{r}
# Set the objective function for the problem.
set.objfn(lprecdual, c(750,900,450,13000,12000,5000,900,1200,750,0,0,0))
# Change the direction to set minimization
lp.control(lprecdual, sense = "min")
```


```{r}
# Set the constraint values row by row
set.row(lprecdual, 1, c(1,20,1,900,450), indices = c(1,4,7,10,12))
set.row(lprecdual, 2, c(1,15,1,900,450), indices = c(1,4,8,10,12))
set.row(lprecdual, 3, c(1,12,1,900,450), indices = c(1,4,9,10,12))
set.row(lprecdual, 4, c(1,20,1,-750,450), indices = c(2,5,7,10,11))
set.row(lprecdual, 5, c(1,15,1,-750,450), indices = c(2,5,8,10,11))
set.row(lprecdual, 6, c(1,12,1,-750,450), indices = c(2,5,9,10,11))
set.row(lprecdual, 7, c(1,20,1,-900,-450), indices = c(3,6,7,11,12))
set.row(lprecdual, 8, c(1,15,1,-900,-450), indices = c(3,6,8,11,12))
set.row(lprecdual, 9, c(1,12,1,-900,-450), indices = c(3,6,9,11,12))
```


```{r}
# Set the right hand side values
rhs2 <- c(420,420,420,360,360,360,300,300,300)
set.rhs(lprecdual, rhs2)
```


```{r}
# Set the constraint type
set.constr.type(lprecdual, c(">=",">=",">=",">=",">=",">=",">=",">=",">="))
```


```{r}
# Set the boundary condiiton for the decision variables
set.bounds(lprecdual, lower = c(0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-1.00e+30,-1.00e+30,-1.00e+30))
```


```{r}
# Solve the linear program
solve(lprecdual)
```


```{r}
# Review the objective function value
get.objective(lprecdual)
```


```{r}
# Get the optimum decision variable values
get.variables(lprecdual)
```

```{r}
get.sensitivity.rhs(lprecdual)
```

```{r}
get.sensitivity.obj(lprecdual)
```
